Here we have created a voting system using Blockchain Technology. Truffle framework is being used to create a decentralised application on Etherium network. Ganache was used to create a local Blockchain. Solidity programming language was used to create smart contracts. Users can cast their votes using their account address along with private key. All this data will be stored in a locally created Blockchain. The final result will be displayed on the screen by using Frontend Technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
